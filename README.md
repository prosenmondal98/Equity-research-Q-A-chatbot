This tool makes news research easy. Simply paste an article's URL and ask questions to get key financial and stock market information.
# Our system works like this:
You give it website addresses or upload files with website links.
It extracts the key information from those articles.
It organizes that information for easy searching.
You ask questions, and it gives you answers directly, with links to the sources.
